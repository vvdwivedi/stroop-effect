    "In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style=\"color:red\">RED</span>, <span style=\"color:blue\">BLUE</span>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <span style=\"color: green\">PURPLE</span>, <span style=\"color: blue\">ORANGE</span>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.\n",

    "We are looking at the response time for saying congruent or incongruent words. Hence we can state that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Congruent and Incongruent words, or the type of word is our **independent variable**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Time taken to say the color of ink in two lists of same size would be our **dependent variable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "With our dependent and independent variables identified, let's set our null and alternate hypothesis. A null hypothesis in this case would be that there is no significant difference between the mean time taken to say colors for congruent (μ<sub>c</sub>) and incongruent (μ<sub>i</sub>) words. Even though it seems likely that incongruent words will take longer time, my alternate hypothesis is that there is a significant difference in time taken for congruent and incongruent lists.\n",

    "Since I am not concerened about the direction, I will certainly go for a two tailed test. My dataset for this test contains 25 records and parameters are not available to me. Given that t distribution is used for small sample sizes with unknown population variance, I will go for a dependent samples t-test and see if we can retain or reject the null hypothesis. Also the same person is taking the test twice, so this falls under the *within-subject* or *repeated-measures* tests.\n",
